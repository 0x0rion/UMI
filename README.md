# UMI

_With duct tape, spit and tears. Brought to you by beest intentions …_

… this is a **Unified Malware Identifier** project (okay, a kick-off).

Inspired by [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier), [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) (and a [data URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)) … the first word has changed. It may be very well **Uniform** (and it is!), but the intention is to **Unify** (we can discuss this :)… and UTF-8. 

**A Unified Malware Indicator of Compromise ID**

According to [Picasso](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Picasso-mean-when-he-joked-good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal-Did-he-really-say-this-or-did-someone-else-say-it?share=1): good artists copy, great artists steal. **UMI** is and always will be free, open and arguable (versioned but uniformed) intended for … whatever is 

… [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) for log files, what [Snort](https://www.snort.org/)/[Suri](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/rules/) is for network traffic and [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) is for files, **UMI** is for … all. But not to replace them, just to identify an arbitraty Indicator of Compromise: a better file hash, domain, URL, IP, SNMP pattern and definitelly a rule; even an event can hide under the lamp. It can be reffered, shortened and hashed. It is a URI. It is a file. It is a rule. It is a standard string.

History: The initial intention was to replace the stupid (Okay, OK, … unsuitable) crypto-based hashes for ever-changing malware files. Add masks and definitely add regexps. First, always, and finally, whatever you can mask or regexp, you can hash (or not). The UMI stays, files change. Domains change, IPs … (4+2).

Future: Just a simple ID for [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) and other IoC taxis. Finally, for MITRE (:) … indexed by MISP or blockchain, whatever U like. Verifiable, but not trackable (got ya) and no UUID needed, just a chain of trust. Hopefully, one day starting by MITRE, ENISA and whoever steals it. It is free.

Just until we make together something even better … **UTI**, a Unified Threat Identifier and **UAI**, a Unified **AI**dentifier. At the moment at [GitHub](https://0x0rion.github.io/UMI/), AWS and **UMI.cx** … (aka Compromise EXchange … <span style="color:gray">or even [sex](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Sex) if U like it … these 3-letter domains aren't really for a song; and there should also be UTI.cx and UAI.cx)</span> … until this becomes an RFC or even an ISO.
